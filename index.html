                    <h4>Trump’s national security adviser added a journalist to text chat on highly sensitive Yemen strike plans</h4>
                    <p>
                        US officials reacted with shock— and in many cases, horror — to revelations in The Atlantic that top members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet sent detailed operational plans and other likely highly classified information about US military strikes on Yemen to a group thread on a messaging app to which a reporter had accidentally been added.
                        
                        The Trump administration acknowledged the messages, sent over the nongovernment encrypted chat app Signal, seem to be authentic without offering any explanation for why senior officials were discussing national defense information outside of approved classified government systems.
                        
                        Almost immediately, senior officials scrambled behind the scenes to review the use of Signal amid concerns that Trump administration officials are relying too heavily on it to conduct sensitive government work – posing a potentially grave risk to US national security, current and former officials said.
                        
                     As soon as the story published, it was blasted out in multiple text threads throughout the Trump administration, with officials reacting with disbelief, according to those who spoke to CNN privately.</p>

                    <h4>John Lithgow says his time on ‘3rd Rock from the Sun’ were his ‘happiest years as an actor’</h4>
                    <p>Oscar-nominated actor John Lithgow, who has portrayed everyone from Winston Churchill to a Cardinal at the Vatican, apparently really misses his days playing an alien.

                        According to Lithgow, his time playing Dick Solomon on the NBC comedy “3rd Rock from the Sun” are years he remembers fondly.
                        
                        “It was the six happiest years as an actor,” Lithgow said on Monday’s episode of the “Smartless” podcast. “Just interacting with this great writing staff, the ‘3rd Rock’ staff was so terrific and it was so inane.”
                        
                        On the sitcom, Lithgow played the high commander of an alien expedition who lands on Earth with his alien cohorts posing as a family.
                        
                        It was a concept that he described as “flat out nutball farce” and something Lithgow never thought he would do.
                        
                        In fact, Lithgow admitted that when the showrunners initially pitched him the idea for the show, he thought, “how do I say ‘no’ to this fast enough?”
                        
                        It only took five minutes for the show to make sense to him, he said, adding that once he heard the full concept, “it just seemed, suddenly, like ‘What in the world have I been waiting for?’”
                        
                        “3rd Rock” debuted on NBC in 1996 and ran until 2001. Jane Curtin, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Kristen Johnston and French Stewart rounded out the cast.
                        
                        The series quickly became a hit and developed a cult following, something that Lithgow said he and his castmates had a feeling would happen before any of the 13 episodes they’d shot aired.

                    <h4>Ranking Cooper Flagg's best NBA fits: Five landing spots where likely No. 1 pick could thrive after Duke</h4>
                    <p>Cooper Flagg is unlike your traditional presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft. Most top prospects go No. 1 because of their scoring. While Flagg -- the Duke star who will be back on the court in the NCAA Tournament on Sunday afternoon -- certainly provides his fair share, it's far from his selling point. Most rookies enter the NBA as defensive projects. With the exception of Victor Wembanyama (who is an anomaly in every sense of the word), Flagg is probably the most polished defensive prospect of the decade. He'll enter the NBA as a fairly advanced playmaker for his position with a jump shot that's improving rapidly. He's even hinted at bucking at recent NBA convention by eschewing the one-and-done path and remaining at Duke for another year.</p>
